My focus is business impact—improving retention, pricing, fraud/risk, and customer experience—while keeping systems safe, observable, and cost-aware (think evals, guardrails, and smart routing for LLMs). I partner tightly with Product, Engineering, Finance, and Risk to prioritize a portfolio that balances ROI, speed, and governance, and I translate model evidence into decisions executives can act on. I set clear strategy, unblock the work, coach ICs into leaders, and foster a culture that values curiosity, accountability, and results.
